* "An Empirical Investigation of Intergenerational Mobility in Korea" 
  > Job Market Paper, This version : [November 2021](https://econ-seunghee.github.io/CV_SeungheeLee.pdf) 
  > Abstract : This paper studies intergenerational income mobility in Korea using a novel approach to understanding how parental socioeconomic status predicts that of children. The conventional approach to measuring mobility is based on the correlation between parents' permanent income and children's permanent income. In contrast, we study how the trajectory of parental incomes across childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood collectively determine a child's future income. This allows one to explore how the timing of income matters beyond its long-run average as well as to understand the years where parental income is relevant. To this end, we employ a functional approach to uncover this relationship. Using KLIPS data, we find that parental income after the mid-teens is crucial for children's economic success. In contrast, parental incomes at other ages are especially powerful predictors of factors that help determine income. Specifically, teen years are essential for college attendance, while the early 20s play a crucial role in offspring's occupation. In addition, living in a single-parent family during the mid-teens tends to harm children's economic and educational success.
